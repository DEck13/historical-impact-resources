# Supplemental materials for our era-adjusted historical impact statistics

Era adjustment is made via [Full House Modeling](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-19/issue-2/Comparing-baseball-players-across-eras-via-novel-Full-House-Modeling/10.1214/24-AOAS1992.short). This model computes era-adjusted statistics through a principled balancing of the impact a historical figure had vs their contemporaries, as judged by [HPI](https://pantheon.world/data/faq), and the size of the eligible population.

## Version 1.1 

- [Here is a reproducible technical report](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DEck13/historical-impact-resources/blob/main/pantheon_history.html) containing the steps for creating our data set for the eligible historical populations that are used in our analyses.
- [Here is a reproducible technical report](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/DEck13/historical-impact-resources/blob/main/pantheon_fullhouse.html) containing the steps the we used to obtain era-adjusted rankings of the impact of historical figures. Additional results and analyses are also provided. 
- [Here is a link](https://github.com/DEck13/fullhouse) to the `fullhouse` R package. This package contains functions that are used to perform the analysis in the previous technical report.
